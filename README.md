This is a Meteor-react boilerplate using Meteor 1.4 and React 15. It has been put together as a baseline for learning Behavior/Test-Driven-Design.

### First run of the app

```bash
npm install
```
### Running the app

```bash
npm start
```

### Scripts

**To lint:**
```bash
npm run lint
```

**Run unit tests**
Run app in one console window.
Then in another console run:
```bash
npm run tests
```

**Run tests with Chimp:**
First run app in one console then open second console and run:
```bash
npm run chimp
```
Chimp will poll your app for changes while you write your tests.

### With Redux
There is a `with-redux` branch with redux and redux-router setup.
```bash
git clone -b with-redux https://github.com/bearcanrun/meteor-react-testing.git
```
